# Assemblies (materials from measurements)

An assembly turns one measurement into the materials and labour it stands for. Measure a wall run once, and its assembly works out the studs, the track, the sheets of board and the insulation, each with a waste allowance, rounded up to whole units and priced if you like.

## Set up assemblies

1. Choose {{Tools > Takeoff > Assemblies…}}.
2. Click **Examples ▾** to start from a partition wall, slab, floor tile, paint or door assembly, or **+ New** to start from nothing.
3. Fill in the assembly:

   | Box | Means |
   |---|---|
   | **Name** | What it is called in pickers, the Markups list and the totals. |
   | **Notes** | How to measure it, what it includes. |
   | **Variables** | Numbers its formulas use by name, such as `Stud Spacing` = `1.333` or `Wall Height` = `9`. |
   | **Items** | One row per material or task. |

4. For each item, give its **quantity formula**: how much of it one measurement needs. Click the names above the table to put them into the formula.

   | Example formula | Works out |
   |---|---|
   | `[Length] / [Stud Spacing] + 1` | studs along a wall |
   | `[Length] * [Wall Height] * 2 / 32` | 4 × 8 sheets of board, both sides |
   | `[Area] * [Thickness] / 27` | cubic yards of concrete |
   | `[Count] * 3` | three hinges a door |
   | `IF([Depth] > 0, [Depth], [Wall Height])` | the measurement's own height if it has one, else the default |

5. Set **Waste %**, tick **Round up** for things bought whole (sheets, boxes, lengths), and add a **Unit cost** if you want prices.
6. Click **Save**.

Formulas are written like spreadsheet formulas: see [Formulas](#formulas) for everything they can do. The window's **How to write a formula** shows the essentials.

A formula can use the measurement's **Quantity**, **Length** (an area's perimeter), **Perimeter**, **Area**, **Volume**, **Wall Area**, **Depth** and **Count** (the items in a count; 1 for anything else), any number or calculation column of the [Markups list](#list-columns), and the assembly's variables. Lengths, areas and volumes are in the page's units: feet and square feet on a feet scale, metres on a metric one.

> **Tip:** Select a measurement before opening the window. The **Selected** column then shows what it comes to as you edit.

## Take off with an assembly

- **Before you measure:** with nothing selected, pick an assembly under **Assembly** in the [Measurements panel](#measurements-panel). Every measurement you draw is taken off as it until you pick another.
- **Afterwards:** select measurements and pick their assembly in the same box. Their quantities are listed under it.

While a measurement's subject is empty (or still the old assembly's name) it is named after its assembly, so the list groups by it. The Markups list also has an **Assembly** column.

## Totals

Choose {{Tools > Takeoff > Takeoff Quantities…}} to add up every measurement's quantities:

- **By Item (for ordering):** the same item, by name and unit, added up across every assembly.
- **By Assembly** or **By Page:** each assembly's items, or each page's.

**Measured** is before waste, **With waste** adds it, and **Total** rounds up where the item rounds. Totals round up once, on the total, as you order: two walls of 3.1 sheets each come to 7 sheets, not 8. **Export CSV** saves the table for a spreadsheet.

## Review a takeoff an AI proposed

In the desktop app, an AI client connected through the local MCP server (File › Preferences › MCP) can **propose** a takeoff: which assembly each measurement should use, why, and the quantities it expects. A proposal changes nothing. It waits for you in {{Tools > Takeoff > Review AI Proposals…}}, a panel beside the sheet that opens by itself when proposals arrive.

For each proposal you see the measurement (click its name to show it on the sheet), the proposed assembly, its variables, each item's formula and quantity, and the AI's reasoning. Where the AI expected a different quantity than the assembly works out, it is marked ⚠.

- **Approve** puts the measurement in the takeoff with that assembly. Change the **Assembly** first to use another one, or type a **Quantity** to set it by hand (waste and rounding still apply).
- **Reject** keeps it out. Choose **All, with decisions** to see rejected proposals and **Review again**.
- To approve several at once, tick them (or **Select all waiting**) and click **Approve Selected**. Nothing is ever approved by itself.

Each approval is saved on the measurement: who approved it, when, and which AI proposal it came from. [[Ctrl+Z]] takes an approval back, and the proposal waits for review again. Proposals and rejections stay on this device.

## Share assemblies

- Assemblies are saved in the PDF, so they open with it, and everyone in a [Live Session](#sessions) shares them.
- **Save to My Assemblies** keeps a copy in this browser. **My Assemblies ▾** brings it into any document.
- **Export** saves them all as a file; **Import…** adds a file's assemblies to this document (one with the same name is replaced).

> **Note:** Quantities depend on the scale and on your formulas. Check them against the drawings before pricing or ordering.
